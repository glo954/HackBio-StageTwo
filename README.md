his repository contains the full workflow and written interpretation for Stage Two of the HackBio Internship. The project focused on analyzing a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset labeled as “bone marrow,” performing UMAP-based clustering, annotating cell types, and evaluating whether the dataset biologically represents true marrow tissue. The repository holds both the computational notebook and the written scientific explanation required for the assignment.
